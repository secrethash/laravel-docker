# Docker for Laravel on Local

Docker Setup for Laravel applications for ***local development*** also supporting multi-tenancy using sub-domains (for ex: foo.localhost, bar.localhost). Tested with [Tenancy for Laravel](https://tenancyforlaravel.com/).

> ***WARNING:*** This setup is not recommended for production as-is.

## Services Included

- **PHP-FPM**
- **NGINX** (server)
- **TRAEFIK** (reverse proxy)
- **SUPERVISOR** (process monitor)
- **MySQL** (database)
- **Redis** (key value database)
- **Memcached** (caching)
- **Meilisearch** (search driver for laravel scout)
- **Mailhog** (email testing)
- **Minio** (S3 on Local)

## Steps to setup

### Initial Setup

1. Use this as a template Repository.
2. Clone the created project from the template.
    > **NOTE:** For Windows users it is recommended to use it inside WSL.
3. Create a `backend` and `frontend` folder inside the `workspace` directory.
4. Copy this project's example.env as .env & update as required.
5. Clone the backend (Laravel) app in your `backend` folder and frontend app in your `frontend` folder.
    - Example: clone `backend` using ssh (on this project's root)

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:organization/backend-repo.git ./workspace/backend
    ```

    - Example: clone `frontend` using ssh (on this project's root)

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:organization/frontend-repo.git ./workspace/frontend
    ```

6. Edit the backend & frontend app's `.env` files according to your needs.
    - Example `.env` values for Laravel Backend:

        ```env
        # Database
        DB_CONNECTION=mysql
        DB_HOST=mariadb
        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_DATABASE=laravel
        DB_USERNAME=laravel
        DB_PASSWORD=password

        # Redis
        REDIS_HOST=redis
        REDIS_PASSWORD=null
        REDIS_PORT=6379

        # Mailer
        MAIL_MAILER=smtp
        MAIL_HOST=mailhog
        MAIL_PORT=1025
        MAIL_USERNAME=null
        MAIL_PASSWORD=null
        MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null

        SCOUT_ELASTIC_HOST="meilisearch:7700"
        SCOUT_PREFIX=

        # Filesystem
        FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=laravel
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=password
        AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
        # create the bucket if not created at:
        # Minio Console: http://localhost:8900 
        AWS_BUCKET=local
        AWS_ENDPOINT=http://minio:9010
        AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT=true
        AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT_MEDIA=true
        AWS_URL=http://localhost:9010/local # local refers to the name of the bucket
        ```

7. Run the docker up command with build & detached flag:

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
    ```

8. Enter the core container to:
    - `composer install`
    - setup laravel using:
        - `php artisan key:generate`
        - `php artisan migrate --seed`
    - `yarn`

    ```sh
    docker exec -it shld-core sh
    ```

9. Re-create the Supervisor Worker:

    ```sh
    docker compose stop supervisor
    docker compose rm supervisor
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Using AWS Signed URL uploads

AWS supports creating a pre-signed url that can then be used to upload files to a specific predefined location, example: `tmp/`. Using this feature with minio as-is is not possible because when the `shld-core` core container listens to `http://minio:9010/*` it understands that the request is for the minio service's container. But when the `http://minio:9010/*` signed url is opened in your browser it doesn't know what this host is. For this we need to update the hosts file (generally located at `/etc/hosts` in linux) to understand `minio -> 127.0.0.1`.

- For Linux Users, edit the hosts file at `/etc/hosts` (you can run `sudo nano /etc/hosts` in terminal) and add this line:

```sh
127.0.0.1       minio
```

- For Mac Users, edit the hosts file located at `/private/etc/hosts` (you can run `sudo nano /private/etc/hosts` in your terminal) and add this line:

```sh
127.0.0.1       minio
```

- For Windows users it is recommended to use [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/). It includes a great [Hosts file editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/hosts-file-editor) tool for easier hosts editing.

## Containers

```sh
[+] Running 10/10
 âœ” Network laravel-docker_shld   Created
---- âš“ Containers ðŸ‘‡ -----------------------
 âœ” Container shld-memcached      Started
 âœ” Container shld-elasticsearch  Started
 âœ” Container shld-redis          Started
 âœ” Container shld-db             Started

 âœ” Container shld-engine         Started
 âœ” Container shld-worker         Started
```

## Starting and stopping

After the initial setup:

1. To bring the containers down you just need to run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose down
    ```

2. If you want to bring them up, just run:

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
    ```

3. To enter the core container's shell to run `composer`, `yarn` & `php artisan` based commands:

    ```sh
    docker exec -it shld-core sh
    ```

## Access URLs

1. **Application:**
    - URL Scheme: `{APP_HOST}:{FORWARD_TRAEFIK_PORT}`
    - Example: `http://localhost`

2. **Minio Console:**
    - URL Scheme: `{MINIO_HOST}:{FORWARD_MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT}`
    - Example: `http://localhost:8900`

3. **MailHog Dashboard:**
    - URL Scheme: `{APP_HOST}:{FORWARD_MAILHOG_DASHBOARD_PORT}`
    - Example: `http://localhost:8025`

4. **Traefik Dashboard:**
    - URL Scheme: `{TRAEFIK_DASH}:{FORWARD_TRAEFIK_DASH_PORT}/dashboard`
    - Example: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard`

## Importing Database from dumps

We bind mount `./dumps` folder to mariadb instance at `/mysql-dumps` so it's always accessible for importing database. To import a database dump, just follow the following process:

1. Put the dump to be imported in `./dumps` folder.
2. Enter the `db` container instance:

    ```sh
    docker exec -it marketplace2-db bash
    ```

    OR using [shld CLI](#use-shld-command-linux)

    ```sh
    jpt db bash
    ```

3. Import DB using `mariadb` command `mariadb -u [DB_USERNAME] -p [DB_DATABASE]`, replacing `{NAME_OF_YOUR_DUMP}` with the name of the dump you copied to `./dump` folder (make sure it's in .sql file format):

    ```sh
    mariadb -u laravel -p laravel < /mysql-dumps/{NAME_OF_YOUR_DUMP}
    ```

    to import a `.sql.gzip` file:

    ```sh
    gunzip < /mysql-dumps/{NAME_OF_YOUR_DUMP}.sql.gz | mariadb -u laravel -p laravel
    ```

## Use `shld` Command (linux)

> **Note:** This also works with WSL linux. This might also work on MacOS (not tested)

Instead of going inside the container interactively every time, then running the desired command, You can use command `shld` to run commands directly:

```sh
shld core artisan about
# OR
shld core composer install
# OR
shld core yarn
```

Where `core` is the container (i.e. `shld-core`) followed by the command that you want to run on that container.

To achieve this you need to setup the shld command first:

1. make `shld_command.sh` executable

    ```sh
    chmod +x ./shld_command.sh
    ```

2. Add source to the bash (if using zsh or anything other than bash, replace the `.bashrc` with the correct one):

    ```sh
    echo -e "\n# SHLD Command\nsource $PWD/shld_command.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

### Commands

To run these basic commands (below) inside the `core` container you don't need to specify `core` in the command, they can be executed directly. To run them in a different container, you will have to specify a container.

#### Example (on core container)

```sh
shld core artisan about
```

So this would also work, and acts as a shorthand:

```sh
shld artisan about
```

#### Example (on supervisor container)

> Note: Although it's an option, it won't be needed for most use cases.

```sh
shld worker artisan about
```

1. Docker compose up

    Proxies: `docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans`

    ```sh
    shld up -b
    ```

2. Docker compose down

    Proxies: `docker compose down`

    ```sh
    shld down
    ```

3. PHP Artisan Commands

    Proxies: `docker compose -it exec shld-core php artisan about`

    ```sh
    shld artisan about
    ```

4. Tinker Command

    Proxies: `docker compose -it exec shld-core php artisan tinker`

    ```sh
    shld tinker
    ```

5. Composer Commands

    Proxies: `docker compose -it exec shld-core composer install`
